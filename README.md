# ProjectForFinalsForJava (Student registration)
First of all I took aikachuwa's project(https://github.com/aikachuwa/RegistrationFormApp4) as template. But there were a lot of things that, I think, are not needed for my project as project for Final Exams.

## Project report (For more information open Wiki of this repository)
My project consists of using GUI, text files, exceptions and classes. The whole project is the registration form for students in university. Firstly appears window that asks to fill fields with student information, this is usage of GUI. Also there another window can appear. Exception were used to let user have no empty inputs and fill them correctly. To consider registered students as objects I made a class "Student" that has name, surname and etc. Text files I used as database to keep the registered students even if the app was closed and reopened.
